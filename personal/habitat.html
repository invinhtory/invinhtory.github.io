        <h1>Habitat for Humanity</h1>

        <hr>

        <p class="project-description"> As a member of Habitat for Humanity's Harvard Chapter, I worked to build affordable housing for families in need across the US and abroad. During my four years of college, I worked across several build sites in Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Costa Rica. I also served as a build coordinator for two years, collaborating with different school organizations to involve 200+ students on 15 weekend builds every year. 

          <br>
          
        In Seattle, I still go on weekend builds when I get a chance!
