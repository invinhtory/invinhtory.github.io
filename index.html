        <p class = "big-paragraph"><b>Hi, I'm Vinh! </b>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/infab/" target="_blank">Integrated Fabrication Laboratory</a>
          in <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> at the University of Washington, advised by Professor Corie L. Cobb. </p> 

        <p class = "big-paragraph"> Currently, my research focuses on developing additive manufacturing (AM) workflows for printing Lithium-ion batteries and integrating them directly into printed electronics. More broadly, I am interested in eveloping novel fabrication workflows to unlock new functional and creative possibilities in device design. I work at the intersection of additive manufacturing (AM), materials science, and computer-aided design (CAD) systems.
