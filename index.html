        <p><b>Hi, I'm Vinh! </b>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/infab/" target="_blank">Integrated Fabrication Laboratory</a>
          in <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> at the University of Washington, advised by Professor Corie L. Cobb. </p> 

        <p>My research centers on developing novel fabrication workflows to unlock new functional and creative possibilities device design. I work at the intersection of additive manufacturing (AM), materials science, and computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Currently, I am working on <a>AM of Lithium-ion batteries</a> and integrating them into <a>printed electronics</a>. I have also worked previously on fabrication workflows for nano-wire bundles </p>
        
        <p>I also work on some personal projects that explore the creative side of fabrication and science. Feel free to check them out!</p>
