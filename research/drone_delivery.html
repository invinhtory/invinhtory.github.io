        <h1>Mobile-Controlled Drone Autonomous Delivery System</h1>
        <h2>Collaborators: Brian Krentz, Mayank Kumar, Yixing Liu, KamFai Tsang, Erin Walk, Billie Wei, Ruilin Wen</h2>
        <h2>Harvard-HKUST Summer Research Program 2015</h2>
        <p>In this summer research program, we were given a drone frame and an open-source hardware controller and tasked with creating a problem statement and solution. This project tasked us to research prior-art applications, perform user research to define technical requirements, and prototype a complete package solution. Inspired by the (then) recent announcement of Amazon Prime Air, we chose to develop a drone delivery system connected to a phone food delivery app. </p> 

        <p>Over the course of the summer, we surveyed a range of potential users and businesses to identify the key features that would be compelling enough for them to use a drone delivery service. From these surveys and our drone capabilities, we defined a set of technical specifications that our project needed to meet. From there, we divided our roles based on our expertise and got to work. </p>

        <p>My responsibilities were primarily with developing the mechanical systems for the drone, while also assisting with the drone hardware and navigation. Over the summer, I developed a mechanism to reliably pick up food containers, safely transport the food, and gently deliver the food onto the ground. I also designed and fabricated a drone chassis to protect the drone electronics. Toward the end of the summer, I also worked on integrating sensors and coding logic for initial object avoidance capabilities. By the end of the summer, we were able to deliver some Hong Kong-style egg tarts to our project advisors!</p>
